# Hi, I'm Mithras! 👋🖥️🚀

I currently work as a cybersecurity consultant specializing in red team operations. My expertise spans artificial intelligence, cognitive neuroscience, and advanced low-level software engineering practices—areas I studied in depth during my graduate studies. Additionally, I have professional experience as a machine learning engineer and data scientist, where I utilized my proficiency in Python, C, and C++ to tackle projects in machine learning, security, data structures, and software architecture.
