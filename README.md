My name is Mithras and I'm a software engineering student at [42 Network](https://www.42.us.org/program/the-42-program) in The Netherlands. Evident from my background in artificial intelligence and theoretical and experimental cognitive neuroscience, my interests lie in conducting scientific research and working on technological developments. Years of work-experience for [Nintendo](https://www.nintendo.nl) as team captain allowed me to me meet hundreds of talented game engineers, ultimately lighting the spark that I decided to become a fully fledged software engineer myself :zap:.

Current personal projects:  
* Implement updated enemy AI in the [Brutal Doom](https://youtu.be/oSzYliSASKc) classic Doom mod.
* Implement true simultaneous co-op mode for Donkey Kong Country (1/2/3). 

<!--- Currently, I work in the IT industry as data scientist and functional designer on a computer vision solution to improve recruitment processes. Specifically, I use psychophysiological biometrics extracted from video-footage to help recruiters make better pre-selection of job candidates. -->
