# Hi, I'm Mithras! 👋🖥️🚀

I'm a software engineering enthusiast from the 42 Network in the Netherlands, currently enrolled in the 42 Advanced program, specializing in Cyber Security. Having completed The Core program, which is akin to a bachelor's degree, I've immersed myself in a curriculum solely dedicated to software programming, unlike traditional education. In the Advanced program, I'm further refining my expertise, aiming to achieve a skill level on par with postgraduate education.

My expertise spans artificial intelligence, cognitive neuroscience, and advanced low-level software engineering practices, areas I've previously studied in university graduate programs. Additionally, I have professional experience as a machine learning engineer and data scientist, where I've utilized my proficiency in Python, C, and C++ to tackle projects in machine learning, security, data structures, and software architecture.
